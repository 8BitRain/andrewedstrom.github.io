I am a Software Engineer. Currently, I work at Pivotal Cloud Foundry, where I contribute to open-source projects like [Concourse](https://concourse.ci/) and [BPM](https://github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/bpm-release). 

My interests lie in distributed systems, cloud computing, security, and AI. I'm also an avid reader and language learner.

I am still in many ways a beginner, but I am determined to keep learning, growing, and improving at my craft. I started this blog to share what I'm learning about all things programming: both technical and otherwise. Whether you are just starting out a career in Software Development, still in school, or considering making a career change and becoming a programmer, this blog is a place where you can go to learn about technical subjects, figure out your career path, and get unstuck.
